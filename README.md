# Learning OpenGL

I'm finally getting around to learning how to use OpenGL properly, which is what this repo is for.
In this repo I will be working through the LearnOpenGL book, and experimenting with using both [GLFW](https://glfw.org) and [RGFW](https://github.com/ColleagueRiley/RGFW).


As I will be following along with the LearnOpenGL book, I am going to initially work through this all in C, though I may later write some simple binds to let me instead work with Zig once I start making more complex programs.
